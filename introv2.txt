Hello, I’m Satish Ranjan. I’ve been working at Capgemini for the last three years, and I have about ten years of experience in IT, with the past four years focused on DevOps. I’m skilled in using Azure, Terraform, Pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes, and Linux. 

Let me give you a quick overview of my current project: 

Current Role Overview 
I am currently working on a UK-based e-commerce project where I manage Azure infrastructure, primarily focusing on automation and migration strategies. 

Daily Workflow 
Morning Stand-Up & Planning  : My day begins with a scrum call where we review daily activities, discuss backlogs, and set priorities for our tasks. I utilize Azure Boards to track our progress and ensure timely completion of assignments. 

CI/CD Pipeline Management : After the stand-up, I check the status of our CI/CD pipelines, typically managed with Jenkins or GitLab, to address any issues from the previous day. I work closely with the development team to troubleshoot 
build problems and optimize automation processes. 

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): A significant part of my role involves infrastructure automation using IaC tools like Terraform. I manage cloud resources, maintaining separate repositories for Terraform modules. This also includes scripting 
and scaling infrastructure as needed. 

Monitoring Infrastructure: Mid-morning, I monitor system health using tools like Prometheus and Grafana. I address any anomalies or alerts from tools such as Splunk to maintain optimal performance and security. 

 Security & Code Review :Security is crucial in my role. I conduct code reviews to identify vulnerabilities using SonarQube, manage secrets with HashiCorp Vault, and handle access management and security audits. 

Troubleshooting & Issue Resolution : Throughout the day, I focus on troubleshooting production issues, analyzing logs, and collaborating with the development team to resolve problems swiftly. 

Collaboration & Knowledge Sharing : I actively participate in cross-team meetings, sharing updates and documenting improvements. This collaboration helps us align our efforts and enhance our processes. 

Learning & Experimentation : I dedicate time to explore new tools and techniques, whether it's a new Kubernetes feature or an improved deployment strategy, to stay current and innovative. 

End of Day Review : At the end of the day, I review progress, update tasks in Jira, and prepare for the next day’s stand-up. 

Key Projects & Responsibilities  :Migration Initiatives: I am involved in migrating monolithic applications to a microservices architecture using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and ArgoCD. So far, we’ve successfully migrated about 40% of our applications, with 60% remaining. Cloud Adoption Framework: I helped transition all applications from on-premises to the Azure Cloud, following the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) for governance, compliance, IAM, monitoring, backup, and disaster recovery. 
Automation of Infrastructure: I automate our infrastructure pipelines with CI/CD processes, ensuring efficient code deployment once changes are approved. 
Monitoring Solutions: I set up monitoring solutions for different projects to ensure performance and security. 
Operational Management: My responsibilities also include managing permissions, addressing production issues, applying patches, performing backups, and troubleshooting network issues.
